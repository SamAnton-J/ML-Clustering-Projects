# **Clustering Algorithms Comparison**

This repository contains implementations of popular clustering algorithms in Python, including:

## **Algorithms Implemented**

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to compare the performance of different clustering algorithms on various datasets. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. The goal is to understand the effectiveness of each algorithm in discovering patterns and structures within the data.

## **Algorithms Description**

- **K-Means Clustering**: A method that partitions data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm iterates between assigning data points to clusters and updating the cluster centroids to minimize the variance within each cluster.

- **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging individual data points into clusters (agglomerative approach) or splitting a large cluster into smaller ones (divisive approach). The algorithm produces a dendrogram, a tree-like diagram that shows the arrangement of the clusters.

## **Conclusion**

By comparing K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, this project aims to provide insights into which algorithm performs better under different conditions and how each can be applied to various types of data. Analysis of the results will help in understanding the strengths and limitations of each clustering technique.
